# Coding Specification

## A Relaxing Instruction

      As you can see, the file name of Coding Specification is writed down in snake case, from which you maybe take a glance at the characteristic of Rust coding. Maybe you are or used to be a C++ programmer and find snake case a bit ugly for you, so you can just insist your coding habit at first and ignore your Rust IDE warning and annoying yellow wavy underlines confidently. As a result, when you finally finish your coding of a project one day and try to construct the project, lots of useless warning message will aggravates your eyes and disturb you from searching for useful message.

      The document is not to restrict coder to follow some confusing rules, but to offer a example to 'insist your coding habit' as well as get rid from yellow wavy underlines.
      Additionally, this document can be a guide book for you to find out the interface file you want when you want to develop some new features.
